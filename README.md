### LLM Axis

This experiment uses GPT-4 to organize words in a 4 quadrant graph.

The tech stack uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

You will need to add your own `.env` file with an OpenAI API key.

Play with the project at [https://llm-axis.vercel.app/](https://llm-axis.vercel.app/).
